                    <p>JavaScript, the ubiquitous scripting language of the web, has a rich history of evolution. From its humble beginnings in the mid-1990s to the sophisticated and powerful language we know today, JavaScript has come a long way. In this article, we'll take a chronological journey through the various ECMAScript (ES) versions, highlighting the key features added in each iteration, leading us to the latest version of the language</p>

                    <h2 class="underline">ES1 (ECMAScript 1) - 1997</h2> 
                    <p>ES1, also known as ECMAScript 1, was the first standardized version of JavaScript. It introduced fundamental features that laid the foundation for the language, including:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>Variables (var): ES1 introduced the var keyword for variable declaration, making it possible to store and manipulate data within scripts.</li>
                        <li>Functions: Functions were at the core of JavaScript's design from the beginning, allowing developers to encapsulate and reuse code.</li>
                        <li>Objects: ES1 included support for creating and manipulating objects, which played a crucial role in defining the language's object-oriented nature.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>ES2 was a minor update that focused on improving the existing features and clarifying the language's specification. No major new features were introduced in this version.</p>

                    <p>ES3 was a significant milestone in JavaScript's history, solidifying its place as the language of the web. Notable features added in ES3 included::</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>Try-Catch: ES3 introduced structured error handling with the try, catch, and finally statements.</li>
                        <li>Regular Expressions: It included support for regular expressions, enabling advanced text pattern matching.</li>
                        <li>New Object Methods: ES3 added methods like Object.create, Object.keys, and Object.defineProperty for working with objects more effectively.</li>

                    <p>ES4 was originally planned but never officially released due to disagreements and challenges in the development process. Instead, efforts shifted to creating smaller, more incremental updates.</p>

                    <p>ES5, also known as ECMAScript 5, was the first standardized version of JavaScript. It introduced fundamental features that laid the foundation for the language, including:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>Strict Mode: ES5 introduced "strict mode," a set of stricter rules to catch common coding mistakes and enhance code quality.</li>
                        <li>JSON Support: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) became a first-class citizen in ES5, simplifying data interchange.</li>
                        <li>Higher-Order Functions: ES5 enhanced support for higher-order functions, making it easier to write expressive and concise code.</li>
                        <li>Array Methods: ES5 added powerful array methods like forEach, map, filter, and reduce.</li>
                        <li>unction Bind: The bind method allowed functions to be bound to a specific context, providing precise control over the this keyword.</li>

                    <h2 class="underline">ES6 (ECMAScript 6) - 2015</h2> 
                    <p>ES6, also known as ES2015, was a game-changer for JavaScript, introducing a plethora of features that modernized the language:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>Arrow Functions: An arrow function is a concise way to write anonymous function expressions. It was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provides a shorter syntax for defining functions. Arrow functions are especially useful for writing compact and more readable code, especially when dealing with functions that have a straightforward structure.</li>
                        <li>Template Literals: Template literals enabled string interpolation, making dynamic string creation more straightforward.</li>
                        <li>Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax for creating and inheriting object prototypes.</li>
                        <li>Promises: Promises were introduced as a part of ECMAScript 2015. They provide a way to handle asynchronous operations with a more readable and maintainable syntax. Promises laid the foundation for improved asynchronous programming in JavaScript.</li>
                        <li>Modules: Modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code into reusable and maintainable components. Modules allow you to separate your code into distinct files or units, each with its own scope, and selectively expose parts of the code for use by other parts of your application.</li>
